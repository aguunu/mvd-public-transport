# Montevideo Public Transportation System Data Processing

## About The Project
Public transport system has an important role in the daily routines of Montevideo's citizens. Transport speed is a fundamental indicator not only for evaluating service performance, but also for controlling speed limits and for several arrival prediction models. This project aims to develop a model capable of estimating public transport speed across Montevideo city, using high-performance computing techniques on several geospatial datasets related to the city's public transport system.
